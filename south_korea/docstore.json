country in\nEast Asia. It constitutes the southern half of the Korean Peninsula and\nborders North Korea along the Korean Demilitarized Zone, with the Yellow\nSea to the west and the Sea of Japan to the east. Like North Korea, South\nKorea claims to be the sole legitimate government of the entire peninsula and\nadjacent islands. It has a population of about 52 million, of which half live in\nthe Seoul Metropolitan Area, the ninth most populous metropolitan area in\nthe world; other major cities include Busan, Daegu, and Incheon.\nThe Korean Peninsula was inhabited as early as the Lower Paleolithic period.\nIts first kingdom was noted in Chinese records in the early seventh century\nBC. From the mid first century BC,[10] various polities consolidated into the\nrival kingdoms of Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla, with the lattermost unifying\nmost of the peninsula for the first time in the late seventh century AD while\nBalhae succeeded Goguryeo in the north. The Goryeo dynasty (918\u20131392)\nachieved lasting unification and established the basis for modern Korean\nidentity. The subsequent Joseon dynasty (1392\u20131897) saw the height of\ncultural, economic, and scientific achievement as well as prolonged peace\nand isolationism from the mid 17th century. The succeeding Korean Empire\n(1897\u20131910) sought modernization and reform but was annexed in 1910 into\nthe Empire of Japan. Japanese rule ended following Japan's surrender in\nWorld War II, after which Korea was divided into two zones: a northern zone,\nwhich was occupied by the Soviet Union, and a southern zone, which was\noccupied by the United States. After negotiations on reunification failed, the\nsouthern zone became the Republic of Korea in August 1948, while the\nnorthern zone became the communist Democratic People's Republic of Korea\nthe following month.\nIn 1950, a North Korean invasion triggered the Korean War, one of the first\nmajor proxy conflicts of the Cold War, which saw extensive fighting\ninvolving the American-led United Nations Command and the Soviet-backed\nPeople's Volunteer Army from China. The war ended in 1953 with an\narmistice but no peace treaty, leading to the ongoing Korean conflict, and left\nthree million Koreans dead and the economy in ruins. South Korea endured a\nseries of dictatorships punctuated by coups, revolutions, and violent\nuprisings, but also experienced a soaring economy and one of the fastest rises\nin average GDP per capita, leading to its emergence as one of the Four Asian\nTigers. The June Democratic Struggle of 1987 ended authoritarian rule and\nled to the establishment of the current Sixth Republic.\nSouth Korea is now considered among the most advanced democracies in\ncontinental and East Asia. Under the 1987 constitution, it maintains a unitary\npresidential republic with a popularly elected unicameral legislature, the\nNational Assembly. South Korea is a major non-NATO ally of the United\nStates and is regarded as a regional power in East Asia and an emerging\npower in global affairs; its conscription-based armed forces are ranked as one\nof the strongest in the world and have the second highest number of military\nand paramilitary personnel. A highly developed country, South Korea's\neconomy is ranked 12th and 14th largest in the world by nominal GDP and\nPPP-adjusted GDP, respectively; it is the world's eleventh-largest exporter\nand seventh-largest importer.\n0:000:00\n/ 0:00/ 0:00\n  South Korea\n  North Korea (claimed but not controlled)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3937, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1425572-88f7-4e32-89bf-c7470097e70c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1425572-88f7-4e32-89bf-c7470097e70c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "South_Korea.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c26e898c-394a-4049-8be0-e148e3ee8a85", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "South_Korea.pdf"}, "hash": "0851545613176429f419362cd606048dfcdd8dc6deb55a01f93f4caab56b59f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1edbaa31-24b8-4b6f-b754-c88c5828adcc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dda89707a604821637eb3b85968c990435afb3fe5e02e2c1df7f79801f08d89d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Demonym(s) South Korean \u00b7 Korean\nGovernment Unitary presidentialrepublic\n\u2022 President Lee Jae-myung\n\u2022 Prime Minister Lee Ju-ho (acting)Kim Min-seok(designated)\n\u2022 Speaker of theNationalAssembly\nWoo Won-shik\n\u2022 Chief Justice ofthe SupremeCourt\nCho Hee-dae\n\u2022 President of theConstitutionalCourt\nKim Hyungdu (acting)\nLegislature National Assembly\nEstablishment history\n\u2022 Gojoseon October 3, 2333 BCE(mythological)\n\u2022 Three Kingdoms 57 BC\n\u2022 Balhae and SillaKingdoms 668\n\u2022 Goryeo dynasty July 25, 918\n\u2022 Joseon dynasty August 13, 1392\n\u2022 Korean Empire October 12, 1897\n\u2022 Japaneseannexation August 29, 1910\n\u2022 Independencefrom Japandeclared\nMarch 1, 1919\n\u2022 ProvisionalGovernment April 11, 1919\n\u2022 Liberation fromJapaneseoccupation\nAugust 15, 1945\n\u2022 US administrationof Korea south ofthe 38th parallel\nSeptember 8, 1945\n\u2022 ROK established August 15, 1948\n\u2022 Currentconstitution February 25, 1988\nArea\n\u2022 Excl.

Under Japanese rule, the two\nnames Han and Joseon coexisted.\nFollowing the surrender of Japan, in 1945, the \"Republic of Korea\" was\nadopted as the legal English name for the new country. However, it is not a\ndirect translation of the Korean name.[24] As a result, the Korean name\nDaehan Minguk (Korean: \ub300\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6d; Hanja: \u2f24\u97d3\u2ea0\u570b; lit.

Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in\nthe 12th century BC, but its existence and role have been controversial in the\nmodern era.[30][32] In 108 BC, the Han dynasty defeated Wiman Joseon and\ninstalled four commanderies in the northern Korean peninsula. Three of the commanderies\nfell or retreated westward within a few decades. As Lelang Commandery was destroyed\nand rebuilt around this time, the place gradually moved toward Liaodong. Thus, its force\nwas diminished and only served as a trade center until it was conquered by Goguryeo in\n313.[33][34][35]\nBeginning around 300 BC, the Japonic-speaking Yayoi people from the Korean Peninsula\nentered the Japanese islands and displaced or intermingled with the original J\u014dmon\ninhabitants.[36] The linguistic homeland of Proto-Koreans is located somewhere in southern\nSiberia/Manchuria, such as the Liao River area or the Amur River area. Proto-Koreans\narrived in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula at around 300 BC, replacing and\nassimilating Japonic-speakers and likely causing the Yayoi migration.[37]\nDuring the Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms period, the states of Buyeo, Okjeo, Dongye, and\nSamhan occupied the whole Korean peninsula and southern Manchuria. From them, the\nThree Kingdoms of Korea emerged: Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla.\nGoguryeo, the largest and most powerful among them, was a highly militaristic state[38]\nand competed with various Chinese dynasties during its 700 years of history. Goguryeo\nexperienced a golden age under Gwanggaeto the Great and his son Jangsu,[39][40][41][42]\nwho both subdued Baekje and Silla during their respective reigns, achieving a brief\nunification of the Three Kingdoms and becoming the most dominant power on the Korean\nPeninsula.[43][44] In addition to contesting control of the Korean Peninsula, Goguryeo had\nmany military conflicts with various Chinese dynasties, most notably the Goguryeo\u2013Sui War, in which Goguryeo defeated a\nhuge force said to number over a million men.[45]\nBaekje was a maritime power,[46] sometimes called the \"Phoenicia of East Asia\".[47] Its maritime ability was instrumental in the\ndissemination of Buddhism throughout East Asia and spreading continental culture to Japan.[48][49] Baekje was once a great\nmilitary power on the Korean Peninsula, especially during the time of Geunchogo,[50] but was critically defeated by\nGwanggaeto the Great and declined. Silla was the smallest and weakest of the three, but used opportunistic pacts and alliances\nwith the more powerful Korean kingdoms, and eventually Tang China, to its advantage.[51][52]\nIn 676, the unification of the Three Kingdoms by Silla led to the Northern and Southern States period, in which Balhae\ncontrolled the northern parts of Goguryeo, and much of the Korean Peninsula was controlled by Later Silla.

Many Korean Buddhists gained great fame among\nChinese Buddhist circles[68] and greatly contributed to Chinese Buddhism.[69] Examples of\nsignificant Korean Buddhists from this period include Woncheuk, Wonhyo, Uisang,\nMusang,[70][71][72][73] and Kim Gyo-gak. Kim was a Silla prince whose influence made\nMount Jiuhua one of the Four Sacred Mountains of Chinese Buddhism.[74]\nIn 936, the Later Three Kingdoms were united by Wang Geon, who established Goryeo as\nthe successor state of Goguryeo.[14][15][75][76] Balhae had fallen to the Khitan Empire in\n926, and a decade later the last crown prince of Balhae fled south to Goryeo, where he was\nwarmly welcomed and included in the ruling family by Wang Geon, thus unifying the two\nsuccessor nations of Goguryeo.[77] Like Silla, Goryeo was a highly cultural state, and\ninvented the metal movable type printing press.[26] After defeating the Khitan Empire,\nwhich was the most powerful empire of its time,[78][79] in the Goryeo\u2013Khitan War, Goryeo\nexperienced a golden age that lasted a century, during which the Tripitaka Koreana was\ncompleted and significant developments in printing and publishing occurred.

Between 1592 and\n1598, Japan under Toyotomi Hideyoshi launched invasions of Korea, but the advance was halted by Korean forces (most\nnotably the Joseon Navy led by Admiral Yi Sun-sin and his renowned \"turtle ship\") with assistance from righteous army militias\nformed by Korean civilians, and Ming dynasty Chinese troops.[88] Through a series of successful battles of attrition, the\nJapanese forces were eventually forced to withdraw, and relations between all parties became normalized. However, the\nManchus took advantage of Joseon's war-weakened state and invaded in 1627 and 1637 and then went on to conquer the\ndestabilized Ming dynasty. After normalizing relations with the new Qing dynasty, Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period\nof peace.

The royal in-law families had gained control of the government, leading to mass corruption and weakening of the\nstate. In addition, the strict isolationism of the Joseon government that earned it \"the hermit kingdom\" became increasing\nineffective due to increasing encroachment from powers such as Japan, Russia, and the United States. This is exemplified by the\nJoseon\u2013United States Treaty of 1882, in which it was compelled to open its borders.\nIn the late 19th century, Japan became a significant regional power after winning the First Sino-Japanese War against Qing\nChina and the Russo-Japanese War against the Russian Empire. In 1897, King Gojong, the last king of Korea, proclaimed\nJoseon as the Korean Empire. However, Japan compelled Korea to become its protectorate in 1905 and formally annexed it in\n1910. What followed was a period of forced assimilation, in which Korean language, culture, and history were suppressed.[91]\nThis led to the March First Movement protests in 1919 and the subsequent foundation of resistance groups in exile, primarily in\nChina. Among the resistance groups was Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea.[92]\nTowards the end of World War II, the U.S. proposed dividing the Korean peninsula into two occupation zones: a U.S. zone and\na Soviet zone. Dean Rusk and Charles H. Bonesteel III suggested the 38th parallel as the dividing line, as it placed Seoul under\nU.S. control. To the surprise of Rusk and Bonesteel, the Soviets accepted their proposal and agreed to divide Korea.[93]\nDespite intentions to liberate a unified peninsula in the 1943 Cairo Declaration,\nescalating tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States led to the\ndivision of Korea into two political entities in 1948: North Korea and South Korea.\nIn the South, the United States appointed and supported the former head of the\nKorean Provisional Government Syngman Rhee as leader. Rhee won the first\npresidential elections of the newly declared Republic of Korea in May 1948. In the\nNorth, the Soviets backed a former anti-Japanese guerrilla and communist activist,\nKim Il Sung, who was appointed premier of the Democratic People's Republic of\nKorea in September.[94]\nIn October, the Soviet Union declared Kim Il Sung's government as sovereign over\nboth the north and south. The UN declared Rhee's government as \"a lawful\ngovernment having effective control and jurisdiction over that part of Korea where the UN Temporary Commission on Korea\nwas able to observe and consult\" and the government \"based on elections which was observed by the Temporary Commission\"\nin addition to a statement that \"this is the only such government in Korea.\"[95] Both leaders engaged in authoritarian repression\nof political opponents.[96] South Korea requested military support from the United States but was denied,[97] and North Korea's\nmilitary was heavily reinforced by the Soviet Union.[98][99]\nOn June 25, 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, sparking the Korean War, the Cold War's first major conflict, which\ncontinued until 1953. At the time, the Soviet Union had boycotted the UN, thus forfeiting their veto rights. This allowed the UN\nto intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior North Korean forces would unify the entire country. The\nSoviet Union and China backed North Korea, with the later participation of millions of Chinese troops. After an ebb and flow\nthat saw both sides facing defeat with massive losses among Korean civilians in both the north and the south, the war eventually\nreached a stalemate. During the war, Rhee's party promoted the One-People Principle, an effort to build an obedient citizenry\nthrough ethnic homogeneity and authoritarian appeals to nationalism.[100]\nThe 1953 armistice, never signed by South Korea, split the peninsula along the demilitarized zone near the original demarcation\nline. No peace treaty was ever signed, resulting in the two countries remaining technically at war. Approximately 3 million\npeople died in the Korean War, with a higher proportional civilian death toll than World War II or the Vietnam War, making it\none of the deadliest conflicts of the Cold War era.[101][102] In addition, virtually all of Korea's major cities were destroyed by\nthe war.[103]\nJapanese occupation and World War II\nDivision of Korea\nKorean War", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4538, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fd63529-8e88-47a4-9b35-b29bb390d7e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fd63529-8e88-47a4-9b35-b29bb390d7e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "South_Korea.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "252846ba-bce8-4c31-835b-ea8bfadd8cde", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "South_Korea.pdf"}, "hash": "7fd3738d3198207f1149e22b9738e5ddbe6c8877dd451400f91dd42d88ffe36a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2ebeda49-9f68-426d-8dc0-192ca5112987", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "794eb5a6361c8b8a0e9e1fcf8684150be661e8fab3154eebbdcb1699b15178c3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Between 1962 and 1994, the South\nKorean economy grew at an average of\n10% annually, fueled by annual export\ngrowth of 20%,[104] in a period called the\nMiracle on the Han River.\nIn 1960, a student uprising (the \"April Revolution\") led to the resignation of the\nautocratic President Syngman Rhee. This was followed by 13 months of political\ninstability as South Korea was led by a weak and ineffectual government. This\ninstability was broken by the May 16, 1961, coup led by General Park Chung Hee.\nAs president, Park oversaw a period of rapid export-led economic growth enforced\nby political repression. Under Park, South Korea took an active role in the Vietnam\nWar.[105]\nPark was heavily criticized as a ruthless military dictator, who in 1972 extended his\nrule by creating a new constitution, which gave the president sweeping (almost\ndictatorial) powers and permitted him to run for an unlimited number of six-year\nterms. The Korean economy developed significantly during Park's tenure. The\ngovernment developed the nationwide expressway system, the Seoul subway\nsystem, and laid the foundation for economic development during his 17-year\ntenure, which ended with his assassination in 1979.\nThe years after Park's assassination were marked again by political turmoil, as the previously suppressed opposition leaders all\ncampaigned to run for president in the sudden political void. In 1979, General Chun Doo-hwan led the coup d'\u00e9tat of December\nTwelfth. Following the coup d'\u00e9tat, Chun planned to rise to power through several measures. On May 17, Chun forced the\nCabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation, which had previously not applied to Jeju Island. The expanded martial law\nclosed universities, banned political activities, and further curtailed the press. Chun's assumption of the presidency through the\nevents of May 17 triggered nationwide protests demanding democracy; these protests were particularly focused in Gwangju, to\nwhich Chun sent special forces to violently suppress the Gwangju Democratization Movement.[106]\nChun subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee and took the presidency according to his\npolitical plan. Chun and his government held South Korea under a despotic rule until 1987, when a Seoul National University\nstudent, Park Jong-chul, was tortured to death.[107] On June 10, the Catholic Priests Association for Justice revealed the\nincident, igniting the June Democratic Struggle across the country. Eventually, Chun's party, the Democratic Justice Party, and\nits leader, Roh Tae-woo, announced the June 29 Declaration, which included the direct election of the president.\nRoh Tae-woo went on to win the 1987 election by a narrow margin against the two main opposition leaders, Kim Dae-jung and\nKim Young-sam. Seoul hosted the Olympic Games in 1988, widely regarded as successful and a significant boost for South\nKorea's global image and economy.[108]\nSouth Korea was formally invited to become a member of the United Nations in 1991. The transition of Korea from autocracy\nto modern democracy was marked in 1997 by the election of Kim Dae-jung, who was sworn in as the eighth president of South\nKorea on February 25, 1998. His election was significant given that he had in earlier years been a political prisoner sentenced to\ndeath (later commuted to exile).

The lack of a strong response to these attacks from both South Korea and the\ninternational community caused significant anger with the South Korean public.[116]\nMiracle on the Han River\nDemocracy", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3731, "end_char_idx": 5040, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "914e67b9-2a61-45f4-a994-fe67bd588f4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "914e67b9-2a61-45f4-a994-fe67bd588f4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "South_Korea.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9640598b-af24-45ca-91c6-fd7804a4d4c5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "South_Korea.pdf"}, "hash": "d36fd0f6596049e64e4f6424dc5c66660fddf5c7476536607fbbf7374365801a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "903aa960-3487-4ed0-9704-e2925315549a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "278c03f95f22024658b9088098f3c9fc922a7d28dd2ceec4c30718178fdedb69", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "President Kim Dae-jung,\nthe 2000 Nobel Peace\nPrize recipient for\nadvancing democracy and\nhuman rights in South\nKorea and East Asia and\nfor reconciliation with\nNorth Korea, was\nsometimes called the\n\"Nelson Mandela of\nAsia\".[109]\nSouth Korea became the first non-G7\nchair of the G-20 when it hosted the 2010\nSeoul summit.[115]\nKorean peninsula satellite image.\nThe children of presidents Park Chung Hee and Kim Jong Il would take power in the two Koreas\nfrom 2011 to 2012.

On January 1, 2007, former South Korean Foreign\nMinister Ban Ki-moon served as UN Secretary-General from 2007 to 2016. South Korea has\ndeveloped links with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as both a member of ASEAN\nPlus three, a body of observers, and the East Asia Summit (EAS). In November 2009, South\nKorea joined the OECD Development Assistance Committee, marking the first time a former\naid recipient country joined the group as a donor member. South Korea hosted the G-20\nSummit in Seoul in November 2010, a year that saw South Korea and the European Union\nconclude a free trade agreement (FTA) to reduce trade barriers. South Korea went on to sign a\nFree Trade Agreement with Canada and Australia in 2014, and another with New Zealand in\n2015. South Korea and Britain have agreed to extend a period of low or zero tariffs on\nbilateral trade of products with parts from the European Union in October 2023.[158]\nBoth North and South Korea claim complete\nsovereignty over the entire peninsula and outlying\nislands.[159] Despite mutual animosity,\nreconciliation efforts have continued since the initial separation between North and\nSouth Korea. Political figures such as Kim Ku worked to reconcile the two\ngovernments even after the Korean War.[160] With longstanding animosity following\nthe Korean War from 1950 to 1953, North Korea and South Korea signed an\nagreement to pursue peace.[161] On October 4, 2007, Roh Moo-Hyun and North\nKorean leader Kim Jong Il signed an eight-point agreement on issues of permanent\npeace, high-level talks, economic cooperation, renewal of train services, highway\nand air travel, and a joint Olympic cheering squad.[161]\nForeign relations\nNorth Korea", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2371, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15b0b700-99ba-4383-95bd-598300c02c43": {"__data__": {"id_": "15b0b700-99ba-4383-95bd-598300c02c43", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "South_Korea.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "118db2f2-91b7-4707-bf12-d1a9850ec2ba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "South_Korea.pdf"}, "hash": "704d9b9d8b9e29a563786ab218da5b8b86ffe3feeaf378909575c664dc4e0479", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "14e6bb83-2a21-45be-b2d1-8ccd4eb9ea2d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c3e5764ef3c7755b516567641781c62a0c323bae4ee837b4677ca85824aca426", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in\nshake hands inside the Peace House.\nSouth Korean president Moon Jae-in\nmeets with Russian president Vladimir\nPutin, 6 September 2017.\nThe Liancourt Rocks have become an\nissue known as the Liancourt Rocks\ndispute.\nDespite the Sunshine Policy and efforts at reconciliation, the progress was\ncomplicated by North Korean missile tests in 1993, 1998, 2006, 2009, and 2013. By\nearly 2009, relationships between North and South Korea were very tense; North\nKorea had been reported to have deployed missiles,[162] ended its former\nagreements with South Korea,[163] and threatened South Korea and the United\nStates not to interfere with a satellite launch it had planned.[164] North and South\nKorea are still technically at war (having never signed a peace treaty after the\nKorean War) and share the world's most heavily fortified border.[165]\nHistorically, Korea had close relations with the dynasties in China, and some\nKorean kingdoms were members of the Imperial Chinese tributary system. The\nKorean kingdoms also ruled over some Chinese kingdoms including the Khitan\npeople and the Manchurians before the Qing dynasty and received tributes from\nthem.[166] In modern times, before the formation of South Korea, Korean\nindependence fighters worked with Chinese soldiers during the Japanese\noccupation. However, after World War II, the People's Republic of China embraced\nMaoism while South Korea sought close relations with the United States. The PRC\nassisted North Korea with manpower and supplies during the Korean War, and in its\naftermath the diplomatic relationship between South Korea and the PRC almost\ncompletely ceased. Relations thawed gradually, and South Korea and the PRC re-\nestablished formal diplomatic relations on August 24, 1992. The two countries\nsought to improve bilateral relations and lifted the forty-year-old trade embargo,[167]\nand South Korean\u2013Chinese relations have improved steadily since 1992.[167] The\nRepublic of Korea broke off official relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan) upon gaining official relations with the\nPeople's Republic of China, which does not recognize Taiwan's sovereignty.[168] China has become South Korea's largest\ntrading partner by far, sending 26% of South Korean exports in 2016 worth $124 billion, as well as an additional $32 billion\nworth of exports to Hong Kong.[169] South Korea is also China's fourth largest trading partner, with $93 billion of Chinese\nimports in 2016.[170]\nFollowing the Korean War, the Soviet Union's relation with North Korea resulted in little contact until the dissolution of the\nSoviet Union. Since the 1990s, there has been greater trade and cooperation between the two nations.\nKorea and Japan have had difficult relations since ancient times but also significant\ncultural exchange, with Korea acting as the gateway between East Asia and Japan.\nContemporary perceptions of Japan are still largely defined by Japan's 35-year\ncolonization of Korea in the 20th century, which is generally regarded in South\nKorea as having been very negative. There were no formal diplomatic ties between\nSouth Korea and Japan directly after independence at the end of World War II in\n1945. South Korea and Japan eventually signed the Treaty on Basic Relations\nbetween Japan and the Republic of Korea in 1965 to establish diplomatic ties. Japan\nis today South Korea's third largest trading partner, with 12% ($46 billion) of\nexports in 2016.[169]\nLongstanding issues such as Japanese war crimes against Korean civilians, the\nnegationist re-writing of Japanese textbooks relating Japanese atrocities during\nWorld War II, the territorial disputes over the Liancourt Rocks, known in South Korea as \"Dokdo\" and in Japan as\n\"Takeshima\",[171] and visits by Japanese politicians to the Yasukuni Shrine, honoring Japanese people (civilians and military)\nkilled during the war continue to trouble Korean-Japanese relations. The Liancourt Rocks were the first Korean territories to be\nforcibly colonized by Japan in 1905.

The free trade agreement was approved in September\n2010, and took effect on July 1, 2011.[178] South Korea is the EU's tenth largest trade partner, and the EU has become South\nKorea's fourth largest export destination. EU trade with South Korea exceeded \u20ac90 billion in 2015 and has enjoyed an annual\naverage growth rate of 9.8% between 2003 and 2013.[179]\nThe EU has been the single largest foreign investor in South Korea since 1962, and accounted for almost 45% of all FDI\ninflows into Korea in 2006. Nevertheless, EU companies have significant problems accessing and operating in the South\nKorean market because of stringent standards and testing requirements for products and services often creating barriers to trade.\nBoth in its regular bilateral contacts with South Korea and through its FTA with Korea, the EU is seeking to improve the current\ngeopolitical situation.[179]\nA close relationship with the United States began directly after World War II, when\nthe United States temporarily administered Korea for three years (mainly in the\nSouth, with the Soviet Union engaged in North Korea). Upon the onset of the\nKorean War in 1950, U.S. forces were sent to defend against an invasion from North\nKorea of the South and subsequently fought as the largest contributor of UN troops.\nThe United States participation was critical for preventing the near defeat of the\nRepublic of Korea by northern forces, as well as fighting back for the territory gains\nthat define the South Korean nation today.\nFollowing the Armistice, South Korea and the U.S. agreed to a \"Mutual Defense\nTreaty\", under which an attack on either party in the Pacific area would summon a\nresponse from both.[180] In 1967, South Korea obliged the mutual defense treaty by\nsending a large combat troop contingent to support the United States in the Vietnam War. The two nations have strong\neconomic, diplomatic, and military ties, although they have at times disagreed with regard to policies towards North Korea and\nwith regard to some of South Korea's industrial activities that involve usage of rocket or nuclear technology. There had also\nbeen strong anti-American sentiment during certain periods, which has largely moderated in the modern day.[181]\nThe two nations also share a close economic relationship, with the U.S. being South Korea's second largest trading partner,\nreceiving $66 billion in exports in 2016.[169] In 2007, a free trade agreement known as the Republic of Korea-United States\nFree Trade Agreement was signed between South Korea and the United States, but its formal implementation was repeatedly\ndelayed, pending approval by the legislative bodies of the two countries. On October 12, 2011, the U.S. Congress passed the\nlong-stalled trade agreement with South Korea.[182] It went into effect on March 15, 2012.[183]\nUnresolved tension with North Korea has prompted South Korea to allocate 2.6% of\nits GDP and 13.2% of all government spending to its military (government share of\nGDP: 14.967%), while maintaining compulsory conscription for men.[184]\nConsequently, the ROK Armed Forces is one of the largest and most powerful\nstanding armed forces in the world with a reported personnel strength of 3,600,000\nin 2022 (500,000 active and 3,100,000 reserve).[185]\nThe South Korean military consists of the Army (ROKA), the Navy (ROKN), the\nAir Force (ROKAF), and the Marine Corps (ROKMC), and reserve forces. Many of\nthese forces are concentrated near the Korean Demilitarized Zone.

There are\napproximately 28,500 U.S. military personnel stationed in South Korea,[192] most of\nthem serving one year unaccompanied tours. The U.S. troops, which are primarily\nground and air units, are assigned to United States Forces Korea and mainly\nassigned to the Eighth Army, Seventh Air Force, and Naval Forces Korea. They are stationed in installations at Osan, Kunsan,\nYongsan, Dongducheon, Sungbuk, Camp Humphreys, and Daegu, as well as at Camp Bonifas in the DMZ Joint Security Area.\nA fully functioning UN Command is at the top of the chain of command of all forces in South Korea, including the U.S. forces\nand the entire South Korean military \u2013 if a sudden escalation of war between North and South Korea were to occur the United\nStates would assume control of the South Korean armed forces in all military and paramilitary moves. There has been long-term\nagreement between the United States and South Korea that South Korea should eventually assume the lead for its own defense.\nThis transition to a South Korean command has been slow and often postponed, although it is currently scheduled to occur in\nthe 2020s.[193]\nSouth Korea's mixed economy[194][195][196] is the 12th largest by nominal GDP and the 14th largest GDP by purchasing power\nparity in the world,[197] identifying it as one of the G20 major economies. It is a developed country with a high-income\neconomy and is the most industrialized member country of the OECD.

The Hyundai\nResearch Institute reported that the Korean Wave has a direct influence on\nencouraging direct foreign investment back into the country through demand for\nproducts, and the tourism industry.[232] Among East Asian countries, China was the\nmost receptive, investing $1.4 billion in South Korea, with much of the investment\nwithin its service sector, a sevenfold increase from 2001.\nAccording to an analysis by economist Han Sang-Wan, a 1% increase in the exports\nof Korean cultural content pushes consumer goods exports up 0.083%, while a 1% increase in Korean pop content exports to a\ncountry produces a 0.019% bump in tourism.[232]\nThe South Korean pension system was created to provide benefits to persons reaching old age, families and persons stricken\nwith death of their primary breadwinner, and for the purposes of stabilizing the nation's welfare state.[233] The structure is\nprimarily based on taxation and is income-related.[234] The system is divided into four categories distributing benefits to\nparticipants through national, military personnel, governmental, and private school teacher pension schemes.[235] The national\npension scheme is the primary welfare system providing allowances to the majority of persons. Eligibility for the national\npension scheme is not dependent on income but on age and residence, where those between the ages of 18 and 59 are\ncovered.[236] Anyone under 18 is a dependent of someone who is covered or under a special exclusion where they are allowed\nto alternative provisions.[237] The national pension scheme is divided into four categories of insured persons \u2013 the workplace-\nbased insured, the individually insured, the voluntarily insured, and the voluntarily and continuously insured. An old-age\npension scheme covers individuals age 60 or older for the rest of their life as long as they have satisfied the minimum of 20\nyears of national pension coverage beforehand.[237]\nScientific and technological development in South Korea at first did not occur\nlargely because of more pressing matters such as the division of Korea and the\nKorean War that occurred right after its independence. It was not until the 1960s\nunder the dictatorship of Park Chung Hee when South Korea's economy rapidly\ngrew from industrialization and the chaebol corporations such as Samsung, LG, and\nSK. Ever since the industrialization of South Korea's economy, South Korea has\nplaced its focus on technology-based corporations, which has been supported by\ninfrastructure developments by the government.\nSouth Korea leads the OECD in graduates in science and engineering.[238] From\n2014 to 2019, the country ranked first among the most innovative countries in the\nBloomberg Innovation Index.[239] It was ranked 6th in the Global Innovation Index\nin 2024.[240] Republic of Korea South Korea today is known as a launchpad of a mature mobile market that allows developers\nto reap benefits of a market where very few technology constraints exist.

Consequently, South Korea has seen the steepest decline in working age\npopulation among OECD nations;[280] the proportion of people aged 65 years and\nover is slated to reach over 20% by 2025 and close to 45% by 2050.[281] The low\nbirth rate has been declared a \"national emergency\" and prompted the creation of a\nnew ministry in May 2024 dedicated to reversing the trend and addressing issues\nrelated to aging, immigration, and the workforce.[270] The government has also\nlaunched various incentives to help entice families to have children, including a\ncash allowance for newborns and greater funding of childcare and fertility treatments.[270]\nGovernment policy, along with a rebound in marriages delayed by COVID-19, may account for the Korean birth rate increasing\nin late 2024;[282] total births in the third quarter were up 8% from the same period last year, marking the largest quarterly\nincrease since the third quarter of 2012 and the first annual rise in total fertility since 2015.[283] Data released in January 2025\nshow the number of births in November 2024 was 20,095, a 14.6% increase year-on-year, the highest growth rate since\nNovember 2010 (which recorded a 17.5% increase), and the third consecutive month of double-digit growth, following\nSeptember's 10.1% and October's 13.4%.[284]\nMost South Koreans live in urban areas following rapid migration from the countryside during the country's rapid economic\nexpansion in the 1970s through the 1990s.[285] About half the population (24.5 million) is concentrated in the Seoul\nMetropolitan Area, making it the world's second largest metropolitan area; other major cities include Busan (3.5 million),\nIncheon (3.0 million), Daegu (2.5 million), Daejeon (1.4 million), Gwangju (1.4 million) and Ulsan (1.1 million).[286]\nPopulation density is estimated at 514.6 per square kilometre (1,333/sq mi) in 2022,[266] more than 10 times the global average.\nThe population has been shaped by international migration.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3899, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99a5b412-2e11-44fc-b25d-6f7e69b20efe": {"__data__": {"id_": "99a5b412-2e11-44fc-b25d-6f7e69b20efe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "South_Korea.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4739630e-d8d6-4432-ab70-2a9ca907c897", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "South_Korea.pdf"}, "hash": "dea103c65696bf5aadd8bda02ef5ce7846ba4da7c56f591c0ea10eec64b6279d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "51882604-b122-4f36-accd-4601cf34aaf3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "South_Korea.pdf"}, "hash": "0ab4ee7909f3813e823583f238c290596d96b16bc918dfec213bbc71f63ee90f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "[284]\nMost South Koreans live in urban areas following rapid migration from the countryside during the country's rapid economic\nexpansion in the 1970s through the 1990s.[285] About half the population (24.5 million) is concentrated in the Seoul\nMetropolitan Area, making it the world's second largest metropolitan area; other major cities include Busan (3.5 million),\nIncheon (3.0 million), Daegu (2.5 million), Daejeon (1.4 million), Gwangju (1.4 million) and Ulsan (1.1 million).[286]\nPopulation density is estimated at 514.6 per square kilometre (1,333/sq mi) in 2022,[266] more than 10 times the global average.\nThe population has been shaped by international migration.

Roman Catholics increased significantly between the 1980s and the 2000s but\ndeclined throughout the 2010s.[3] Christianity, unlike in other East Asian countries, found\nfertile ground in Korea in the 18th century, and by the end of the 18th century it\npersuaded a large part of the population, as the declining monarchy supported it and\nopened the country to widespread proselytism as part of a project of Westernization.

Christianity's similarity to native\nreligious narratives has been studied as another factor that contributed to its success in the peninsula.[303] The Japanese\ncolonization of the first half of the 20th century further strengthened the identification of Christianity with Korean nationalism,\nas the Japanese coopted native Korean shamanism into the Nipponic Imperial Shinto that they tried to establish in the\npeninsula.[304] Widespread Christianization of the Koreans took place during State Shinto,[304] after its abolition, and then in\nthe independent South Korea as the newly established military government supported Christianity and tried to utterly oust\nnative shamanism.\nAmong Christian denominations, Presbyterianism is the largest. About nine million\npeople belong to one of the hundred different Presbyterian churches; the biggest\nones are the HapDong Presbyterian Church, TongHap Presbyterian Church and the\nKoshin Presbyterian Church.

Historically, while the culture has been heavily influenced by that\nof neighboring China, it has nevertheless independently managed to develop a\nunique cultural identity in its own right that is distinct from that of its larger\nneighbor on the East Asian mainland.[325] As of 2024, South Korea has 24\nUNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity,[326] along with 16 World\nHeritage Sites.[327] The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism actively\nencourages the traditional arts, as well as modern forms, through funding and\neducation programs.[328] According to the 2023 edition of the Press Freedom Index,\nSouth Korea has the second highest level of press freedom in Continental and East\nAsia, behind Taiwan.[329]\nHealth\nCulture", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3607, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "606db928-cc52-4080-8e26-b4e424751bb2": {"__data__": {"id_": "606db928-cc52-4080-8e26-b4e424751bb2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "South_Korea.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "968be174-92aa-43a5-98d3-bc2f70d7e18d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "South_Korea.pdf"}, "hash": "64235aff326640fb8fa0c8a365f09134c654b39e5dcf66ebc9541951a3c1266e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "A blue and white porcelain\npeach-shaped water dropper\nfrom the Joseon dynasty in the\n18th century\nNamdaemun\nBulguksa, a UNESCO World Heritage\nSite\nIndustrialization and urbanization have brought many changes to the way modern Koreans live. Changing economic\ncircumstances and lifestyles have led to a concentration of population in major cities, especially the capital Seoul, with multi-\ngenerational households separating into nuclear family living arrangements. A 2014 Euromonitor study found that South\nKoreans drink the most alcohol on a weekly basis compared to the rest of the world. South Koreans drink 13.7 shots of liquor\nper week on average and, of the 44 other countries analyzed, Russia, the Philippines, and Thailand follow.[330]\nKorean art has been highly influenced by Buddhism and Confucianism, which can be seen in\nthe many traditional paintings, sculptures, ceramics and the performing arts.[331] Korean\npottery and porcelain, such as Joseon's baekja and buncheong, and Goryeo's celadon are well\nknown throughout the world.[332] The Korean tea ceremony, pansori, talchum, and\nbuchaechum are also notable Korean performing arts.\nPost-war modern Korean art started to flourish in the 1960s and 1970s, when South Korean\nartists took interest in geometrical shapes and intangible subjects. Establishing a harmony\nbetween man and nature was also a favorite of this time. Because of social instability, social\nissues appeared as main subjects in the 1980s. Art was influenced by various international\nevents and exhibits in Korea, which brought more diversity.[333] The Olympic Sculpture\nGarden in 1988, the transposition of the 1993 edition of the Whitney Biennial to Seoul,[334]\nthe creation of the Gwangju Biennale[335] and the Korean Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in\n1995[336] were notable events.\nBecause of South Korea's tumultuous history, construction and destruction has been\nrepeated endlessly, resulting in an interesting melange of architectural styles and\ndesigns.[337]\nTraditional Korean architecture is characterized by its harmony with nature. Ancient\narchitects adopted the bracket system characterized by thatched roofs and heated\nfloors called ondol.[338] People of the upper classes built bigger houses with\nelegantly curved tiled roofs and lifting eaves. Traditional architecture can be seen in\nthe palaces and temples, preserved old houses called hanok,[339] and special sites\nlike Hahoe Folk Village, Yangdong Folk Village and Korean Folk Village.\nTraditional architecture may also be seen at several of the UNESCO World Heritage\nSites.[340]\nWestern architecture was first introduced at the end of the 19th century. Churches,\noffices for foreign legislation, schools and university buildings were built in new\nstyles. With the annexation by Japan in 1910 the colonial regime intervened in\nKorea's architectural heritage, and Japanese-style modern architecture was imposed.\nAnti-Japanese sentiment and the Korean War led to the destruction of most\nbuildings constructed during that time.[341]\nModern Korean architecture entered a new phase of development during the post-\nKorean War reconstruction, incorporating modern architectural trends and styles.\nStimulated by the economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s, active redevelopment\nsaw new horizons in architectural design. In the aftermath of the 1988 Seoul\nOlympics, South Korea has witnessed a wide variation of styles in its architectural\nlandscape with the opening up of the market to foreign architects.[342] Contemporary architectural efforts have attempted to\nbalance the traditional philosophy of \"harmony with nature\" and the fast-paced urbanization that the country has been going\nthrough in recent years.[343]\nArt\nArchitecture", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3724, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "21f2f079-f6da-4c76-bd03-a41646370032": {"__data__": {"id_": "21f2f079-f6da-4c76-bd03-a41646370032", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "South_Korea.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "360a72a5-d782-4d89-aeea-6fc979163b32", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "South_Korea.pdf"}, "hash": "b66f4b74ce7815db43e601faf1966e8040a56606a6d5a2746c40ca746caa9b72", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "K-pop group BTS has emerged as one of\nthe country's most successful Korean boy\nbands since their rise to international\nprominence during the latter half of the\n2010s.\nBlackpink has been one of the most\npopular K-pop girl groups in the world\nsince the late 2010s.\nPeople cosplaying as guards from the\nseries\nIn addition to domestic consumption, South Korea has a thriving entertainment\nindustry where various facets of South Korean entertainment, including television\ndramas, films, and popular music, have garnered international popularity and\ngenerated significant export revenues for the nation's economy. The cultural\nphenomenon known as Hallyu or the \"Korean Wave\", has swept many countries\nacross Continental and East Asia making South Korea a major soft power as an\nexporter of popular culture and entertainment, rivaling Western nations such as the\nUnited States and the United Kingdom.[344][345][346][347][348]\nUntil the 1990s, trot and traditional folk-based ballads dominated the South Korean\npopular music scene. The emergence of the pop group Seo Taiji and Boys in 1992\nmarked a turning point for South Korean popular music, also known as K-pop.\nSince the 1990s, the genre of K-pop has continuously engaged in a process of\nongoing reinvention and modernization by assimilating various elements of popular\nmusical genres and trends from across the world such as Western popular music,\nexperimental, jazz, gospel, Latin, hip hop, rhythm and blues, electronic dance,\nreggae, country, folk, and rock on top of its uniquely traditional Korean music\nroots.[349] Though Western-style pop, hip hop, rhythm and blues, rock, folk,\nelectronic dance oriented acts have become dominant in the contemporary South\nKorean popular music scene, trot still continues to be appreciated and enjoyed by\nolder South Koreans. K-pop idols are well known across Continental Asia, have\nfound fame in the Western World, and have generated millions of dollars in export\nrevenue beyond the confines of the traditional East Asian music market. Many K-\npop acts have also established themselves by securing a strong global following\nusing online social media platforms such as YouTube. K-pop first began to make its\nmark outside of Continental and East Asia following the unexpected success of\nsinger Psy's international music sensation, \"Gangnam Style\", which topped global music charts in 2012.\nSince the success of the film Shiri in 1999, the Korean film industry has grown substantially, garnering recognition both nation-\nwide and across the globe. Domestic films have a dominant share of the South Korean film market, partly because of the\nexistence of government screen quotas requiring cinemas to show Korean films for at least 73 days of the year.[350] 2019's\nParasite, directed by Bong Joon-ho, became the highest-grossing film in South Korea as well as the first non-English language\nfilm to win Best Picture at the United States-based Academy Awards that year amongst numerous other accolades.\nSouth Korean television shows have become popular outside of Korea. Television\ndramas, known as K-dramas, have begun to find fame internationally. Many dramas\ntend to have a romantic focus. Historical dramas are also famous.[351][352] The 2021\nsurvival drama Squid Game, created by Hwang Dong-hyuk, received critical\nacclaim and widespread international attention upon its release, becoming Netflix's\nmost-watched series at launch and garnering a viewership of more than 142 million\nhouseholds during its first four weeks from launch.[353][354][355][356]\nThe Korean New Year, or \"Seollal\", is celebrated on the first day of the Korean\ncalendar.

The Korean royal court cuisine once brought all of the\nunique regional specialties together for the royal family. Meals consumed both by\nthe royal family and ordinary citizens have been regulated by a unique culture of\netiquette.\nKorean cuisine is largely based on rice, noodles, tofu, vegetables, fish and meats.\nTraditional meals are noted for the number of side dishes, banchan, which\naccompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Every meal is accompanied by numerous\nbanchan. Kimchi, a fermented, usually spicy vegetable dish is commonly served at every meal and is one of the best known\ndishes. Korean cuisine usually involves heavy seasoning with sesame oil, doenjang (a type of fermented soybean paste), soy\nsauce, salt, garlic, ginger, and gochujang (a hot pepper paste). Other well-known dishes are bulgogi, grilled marinated beef;\ngimbap; and tteokbokki, a spicy snack consisting of rice cake seasoned with gochujang or a spicy chili paste.\nSoups are also a common part of a meal and are served as part of the main course rather than at the beginning or the end of the\nmeal. Soups known as guk are often made with meats, shellfish and vegetables. Similar to guk, tang has less water and is more\noften served in restaurants. Another type is jjigae, a stew that is typically heavily seasoned with chili pepper and served boiling\nhot.\nPopular Korean alcoholic drinks include Soju, Makgeolli and Bokbunja ju. Korea is unique among East Asian countries in its\nuse of metal chopsticks. Metal chopsticks have been discovered in Goguryeo archaeological sites.[357]\nThe martial art taekwondo originated in Korea. In the 1950s and 1960s, modern\nrules were standardized, with taekwondo becoming an official Olympic sport in\n2000.[358] Other Korean martial arts include Taekkyon, hapkido, Tang Soo Do, Kuk\nSool Won, kumdo and subak.[359]\nFootball has traditionally been regarded as the most popular sport in Korea, with\nbaseball as the second.[360] Recent polling indicates that a majority, 41% of South\nKorean sports fans continue to self-identify as football fans, with baseball ranked\n2nd at 25% of respondents. However, the polling did not indicate the extent to\nwhich respondents follow both sports.[361]\nThe national football team became the first team in the Asian Football\nConfederation to reach the FIFA World Cup semi-finals in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, jointly hosted by South Korea and Japan.\nThe Korea Republic national team (as it is known) has qualified for every World Cup since Mexico 1986, and has broken out of\nthe group stage in 2002, in 2010, when it was defeated by eventual semi-finalist Uruguay in the Round of 16, and in 2022. At\nthe 2012 Summer Olympics, South Korea won the bronze medal for football.\nBaseball was first introduced to Korea in 1905.[362][363][364] Recent years have been characterized by increasing attendance and\nticket prices for professional baseball games.[365][366] The Korea Professional Baseball league, a 10-team circuit, was\nestablished in 1982. The South Korea national team finished third in the 2006 World Baseball Classic and second in the 2009\ntournament.
